# AsteroidsML
A neural network that can be trained to win the arcade game Asteroids

Currently I am working on emulating the game, and I am facing some issues (mostly due to my unfamiliarity with Pygame). Once I work through those I will begin the process of creating the AI, and I will probably be using some implementation of NEAT.
